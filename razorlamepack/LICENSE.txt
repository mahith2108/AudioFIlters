The rules governing the use of RazorLame and the RazorLame source code
are derived from the official Open Source Definition, available at
http://www.opensource.org. The conditions and limitations are as
follows: 

You may not use the RazorLame source code to create and distribute
custom versions of RazorLame under the "RazorLame" name. If you do
modify and distribute custom versions of RazorLame, the binary
distribution must be named differently and clearly marked so users can
tell they are not using the official RazorLame distribution. A visible
and unmodified version of this license must appear in any modified
distribution of RazorLame. 

Custom distributions of RazorLame must include all of the custom
changes as a patch file that can be appplied to the original source
code. This restriction is in place to protect the integrity of the
original author's source code. No support for modified versions of
RazorLame will be provided by the original authors. 

Works which add significant value to the components and code within
RazorLame need not be distributed under the open source license.
However, the application must include a reference to RazorLame along
with a URL in either the about box, readme file or help file.
Applications which use this work and do not add significant value to the
work presented within RazorLame must be distributed under the Open
Source license. Holger Dors will be the final arbitrator as to what
consists of significant added value. 

Please note that Holger Dors and the other contributing authors hereby
state that this package is provided "as is" and without any express or
implied warranties, including, but not without limitation, the implied
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. In
other words, we accept no liability for any damage that may result from
using RazorLame or programs that use the RazorLame source code. 

If you have questions about this license, please email Holger Dors at

Can I use LAME.EXE in my commercial program?  

Yes, you can, under the restrictions of the LGPL.  The easiest
way to do this is to:

1. Link to LAME as separate library (libmp3lame.a on unix or 
   lame_enc.dll on windows)

2. Fully acknowledge that you are using LAME, and give a link
   to our web site, www.mp3dev.org

3. If you make modifications to LAME, you *must* release these
   these modifications back to the LAME project, under the LGPL.


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

The decoding functions provided in LAME use the mpglib decoding engine which
is under the GPL.  They may not be used by any program not released under the
GPL unless you obtain such permission from the MPG123 project (www.mpg123.de).
