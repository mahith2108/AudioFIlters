Readme file for RazorLame 1.2.0
===============================

What is RazorLame?
------------------
RazorLame is a so-called front-end for use with LAME.

LAME is a great MP3-Encoder: it's very fast, it produces 
high-quality files, has many advanced features (like 
Variable Bitrates and Joint-Stereo), and it's open source. 

Unfortunately, it is a command line utility, and that is 
where RazorLame comes in: it provides an easy-to-use 
graphical user-interface which makes MP3-encoding even 
easier!

You can find more about LAME at http://www.mp3dev.org/

(*) Removed XP-like menus and toolbars, added
    XP-standard alike menu and other XP look
    to the GUI (shows only under Windows XP)

Version 1.1.5 (12. December 2001)

    menus and toolbars, support for XP Themes
(*) enhanced & nicer histogram display
(*) progress dialog remembers if histogram was shown
(+) double click on listview entries starts 
    associated program
(*) Application Title now shows batch progress
(*) Status Bar shows current LAME setting
(*) added more option files which are similar
    to the presets of LAME 3.90
(-) yet another try to fix the "average value missing" bug
(-) should fix problems with large fonts
(-) fixed decimal-point problem for rlo files
(-) some smaller changes and bug fixes

Version 1.1.4 (12. April 2001)
(+) Added some option files. Thanks to Gabriel Bouvigne 
    of http://www.mp3-tech.org for providing them!
(-) Now handles the "use source" checkbox for the
    output directory correctly
(-) histogram is now displayed correctly for all 
    VBR/ABR modes
(-) Summary line for ABR/VBR ("average bitrate") is finally 
    added to log for all cases. (I hope...)
(*) Files > 2 GB are correctly displayed now, however,
    progress isn't displayed on large file for now
(-) some smaller fixes

Version 1.1.3
was an internal-only release and is now the base
for 1.2.0, which is currently developed. Current source
of 1.2.0 can be obtained through CVS at 
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/razorlame

Version 1.1.2a (26. March 2001)
(-) Added some messages to RazorLame.dat, as there was trouble
    with some popular compiled versions of lame 3.88 beta

Version 1.1.2 (21. January 2001)
(+) If LAME outputs a histogram during encoding, RL can now display 
    this histogram graphically as well.
(+) You can now set the default priority of the encoding thread.
(+) You can now choose what RL should do if "shutdown Windows when
    done" is checked. Options include Hibernate, Suspend, Log Off,
    Just close RL, Reboot, and of course, shutdown.
(+) You can now save option settings in a file. And of course
    load them again ;-)
(*) The progress window is now resizable.
(*) The option dialog is now splitted in a "program" options and a
    "LAME" options dialog.
(*) The LAME options dialog now always show the resulting LAME 
    switches without the need for pressing a "show" button.
(*) You can now move columns of the listview.
    However, layout of listview isn't stored yet.
(*) "View Log" window now has a "delete log" button.
(*) added support for "--athshort" and "-q" switches.
    Added a "default" mode for the channel modes.
(*) hopefully the output directory option is now more intuitive.
(-) RL now uses less CPU time (i.e. it updates the progress window
    only once in a second, when in tray it updates it only every
    ten seconds.)
(-) fixed problems with some mp3 files (e.g. "trimmed") 
    when decoding or re-encoding
(-) Probably more smaller fixes I cannot think of right now.
    

Version 1.1.1 (29. October 2000) 
(*) better handling of LAME 3.87 beta
(*) Nicer application icon and toolbar images,
    thanks to Jan Hryz <jan.hryz@email.cz>    
(*) You can now delete files after decoding as well!
(*) Improved listview, shows associated icon and type
(*) Improvements for handling a lot of files
(*) some smaller, rather cosmetic changes
(-) "-B" option was ignored for ABR


Version 1.1.0 (20. August 2000) 
(+) You can now decode mp3 files using LAME! 
    (Needs at least version 3.84!)
(+) added support for --abr 
    (average bitrate aka Safe VBR)
(*) Some system stuff is now read from a *.dat file
    This allows for a bit more flexibility in regard
    of future LAME versions.
(*) Hints are now visible for 10 seconds so those
    in the options dialog can be better read
(*) When sorting paths, use filename as second sort 
    criteria
(*) Same small, rather cosmetic changes
(-) fixed a bug when entering an output directory
    without a trailing backslash lead to unexpected
    results


Version 1.0.2 (02. July 2000)
(+) new advanced option: delete file after encoding
(+) When VBR is used, show bitrate histogram on log 
    (if encoder version outputs it!)
(*) Progress dialog now also shows elapsed time for batch
(-) when no output directory is given, encoded file
    is stored where input file is
(-) making it impossible to set the quality in the 
    VBR tab of the options higher than 9
(-) Delete 0 byte output files after an error occurred


Version 1.0.1 (25. June 2000)
First public release.
Some bug fixes, some improvements.
